Developed a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Implemented multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and optimized hyperparameters for improved predictions.
